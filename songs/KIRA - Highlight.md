[Verse]
Turn it up to the top
Let's get it started, go non-stop
Bust through the door, we don't knock
Just have a good time
Like we never cared about what they say
Tear up the place like it's our own
Get wilder than a cyclone
And leave it on a high note

And it's just like magic lighting up the sky
Yeah, when we're together we don't have to try
If you wanna join then this is your invite
Show 'em what you got, come on
Don't be shy!

[Chorus]
We
We are breaking through borders
Free
Like the clouds are beneath us, oh
We
We're like diamonds in starlight
We shine in the dark night
'Cause we are the highlight

We (We are)
We're just living this moment
Free (Free, yeah)
On this path that we've chosen, oh
We (We are)
We're like diamonds in starlight
We shine in the dark night
'Cause we are the highlight

[Verse]
Caught inside a bubble full of doubts
It's time to make it pop!
Baby, just believe it, feel it
Lose control, it's in your blood
You know there ain't nobo-bo-body getting down like we do
There ain't no pa-pa-party like a party with Miku!!!

And it's just like magic lighting up the sky
Yeah when we're together we don't have to try
If you wanna join then this is your invite
Show 'em what you got, come on
Don't be shy!

[Chorus]
We
We are breaking through borders
Free
Like the clouds are beneath us, oh
We (We are)
We're like diamonds in starlight
We shine in the dark night
'Cause we are the highlight

We (We are)
We're just living this moment
Free (Free, yeah)
On this path that we've chosen, oh
We (We are)
We're like diamonds in starlight
We shine in the dark night
'Cause we are the highlight

Ah yeah

[Bridge]
Don't lose your dream
Make it reality, baby
Don't lose your dream
Make it
Now everybody let me hear you say..
Don't lose your dream
Go and make history, baby
Don't lose your dream

[Chorus]
We
We are breaking through borders
Free
Like nobody can stop us, oh
We are diamonds in starlight
'Cause you know that we are

We (We are)
We are breaking through borders
Free (Free, yeah)
Like the clouds are beneath us, oh
We (We are)
We're like diamonds in starlight
We shine in the dark night
'Cause we are the highlight

We (We are)
We're just living this moment
Free (Free, yeah)
On this path that we've chosen, oh
We (We are)
We're like diamonds in starlight
We shine in the dark night
'Cause we are the highlight
