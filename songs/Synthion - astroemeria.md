```
[Verse]
The garden breathes
Life into the air
The flowers bloom
Watered by my tears

The silence speaks
With comforting words
My worries fading away as I hear:

“It’s okay, it’s alright”
I’ll move on with my life
The petals surround me
Guiding my way

I’m flying, I’m soaring
Along the flower path
A new start, beginning my future today

(I’ll be okay)

Dear moon (Dear moon)
Dear stars (Dear stars)
Hold me (Hold me)
In your arms

[Chorus]
Under the galaxies I’ll wish to the stars
And let a miracle wash away my fears
Even if everything seems daunting at first
I know (I know)
I can take a deep breath

Another melody I sing from my heart
With words and messages written in the sky
I’ll do my best, you’ll see, just watch from afar
‘Cause I know (I know)
It’s not as hard as it seems

[Verse]
The garden breathes
Life into the air
The flowers bloom
Watered by my tears

The silence speaks
With comforting words
My worries fading away as I hear:

“It’s okay, it’s alright”
I’ll move on with my life
The petals surround me
Guiding my way

I’m flying, I’m soaring
Along the flower path
A new start, beginning my future today

(I’ll be okay)

Dear moon (Dear moon)
Dear stars (Dear stars)
Hold me (Hold me)
In your arms

[Chorus]
Under the galaxies I’ll wish to the stars
And let a miracle wash away my fears
Even if everything seems daunting at first
I know (I know)
I can take a deep breath

Another melody I sing from my heart
With words and messages written in the sky
I’ll do my best, you’ll see, just watch from afar
‘Cause I know (I know)
It’s not as hard as it seems
