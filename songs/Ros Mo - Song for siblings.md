```
I know I smack you a lot
And that you've always hit back
We've fought so many times, I'm starting to lose track
We've had so many years just tolerating each other

I did a nice gesture for you
You thought I'm pranking you too
Too?
What do you mean "too"?
Answer me! What the hell did you do?!
"It's nothing!" you said
So in return, I hit your head and ran away

We don't see eye to eye
And we fight 23/7
But if anyway makes you cry
+1 person straight to heaven
'Cuz the only person who can make your life a living hell is me
No one can compete
I was doing this when we were only three
I'm a pro at making trouble even mom can't see
Then I'll blame it on you cuz they never blame me
You are my sibling and I'll never show affection to you cuz...
blargh[fn]Vomit noises in key of sibling[/fn]
I'll just show it by annoying you 30 times a day
