[Verse]
Among all the stars that shine in the sky
There's one special star that always stands out every night
Won't you be my star (won't you be my star)
I've always been hoping that you'll guide me with your light

[Chorus]
And anytime I lose my way (lose my way)
You'll be there
I'll be always there with you
Until those countless lights go out, and still

Forever and beyond with you (still with you)
I'll be there
Let my eternal vow be heard across the universe
And reach you, my very first star

[Bridge]
And even when I close my eyes (close my eyes)
You're still there
Feels just like a gentle dream
I want to fall into your warmth tonight

Each second that I spend with you
This moment lights my life
If only I could stop the hands of time
And stay here forevermore

[Chorus]
And anytime I lose my way (lose my way)
You'll be there
I'll be always there with you
Until those countless lights go out, and still

Forever and beyond with you (still with you)
I'll be there
Let my eternal vow be heard across the universe
And reach you, my very first star

You'll always be, my very first star
