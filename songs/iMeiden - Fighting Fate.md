```
[Verse 1]
Breathing heavily
Moving steadily
Stuck in reverie
Dreaming of the future
Wish it would come sooner
Need a morale booster
Prove I'm not a loser
Not anymore

Taking baby steps
Growing to my strengths
Inches, miles, lengths
And progress soon will show
Endurance will grow
Lactic acid slows
Still too far for me to know

[Chorus]
But if I give up, stitches will come undone
And I'll not see the person I'll become
It's not gonna be today
Not gonna hide away
Tomorrow will be okay
Not gonna be today

If I wake up revitalised and primed
I'll return to the battle every time
I'm gonna keep fighting fate
Don't wanna be too late
Keep running at 128
Gonna keep fighting fate

[Verse 2]
Heart is pounding fast
People blurring past
Gotta make it last
Keep those muscles burning
Pushing through the hurting
Stop the past returning
Nothing stops me working
Not anymore

Taking leaps of faith
Working my own way
And if I hate today
Endorphins break the border
Restore natural order
Thank me when I'm older
For when I work harder now

[Chorus]
But if I give up, stitches will come undone
And I'll not see the person I'll become
It's not gonna be today
Not gonna hide away
Tomorrow will be okay
Not gonna be today

If I wake up revitalised and primed
I'll return to the battle every time
I'm gonna keep fighting fate
Don't wanna be too late
Keep running at 128
Gonna keep fighting fate
```
