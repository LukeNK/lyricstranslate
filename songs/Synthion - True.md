[Verse: Hakuno♠]
Will no one see the person I know I am?
Will no one hear the voice that cries out from my heart?
The "me" within your eyes
The "me" I see inside
Can anyone perceive and love my truth?

[Prechorus: Sumire♥]
Won't you believe in a future where you can be you?
Won't you believe in a world that knows your reality?
I know all of it feels like a far-off dream but
Won't you believe as I believe in you?

[Chorus: Hakuno♠]
Can I believe in a future where I can be me?
Can I believe in a world that knows my reality?
Even now it still feels like a far-off dream but
When you are here it seems like it could be true

[Verse: Hakuno♠]
Will no one see the person I know I am?
Will no one hear the voice that cries out from my heart?
The "me" within your eyes
The "me" I see inside
Can you be the one to share my truth?

[Prechorus: Sumire♥]
Won't you believe in a future where you can be you?
Won't you believe in a world that knows your reality?
Although all of it feels like a far-off dream but
I promise to you my dear, it will all come true

[Chorus: both]
Can we believe in a future where you can be you?
Can we believe in a world that knows my reality?
Even now it still feels like a far-off dream but
Somehow together we will make it true
