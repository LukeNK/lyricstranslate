```
[Verse 1]
Even though you promised, you’d stay by my side
I didn’t even get to say goodbye
Where did you go? Why did you leave?
I do not know where you could be
But now I’m on my own

The earth is spinning
I, too, am spinning?
But why does it seem
We’re not at the same speed

Falling behind
Falling behind
You left behind a piece of you sitting here in my mind
Even though we follow the same laws of the universe
Our lives diverge inevitably
One moment can mean anything

Find the light that guides you safely through your times of darkness
If you reach the other side
I’ll be waiting with arms open wide

[Verse 2]
I remember when our teacher taught us
“Moment of inertia” - is tau over alpha
If I increase force that is used
Then will I be able to move
The resting parts of me

I play with the numbers
I need more power
Applying pressure
To push me forward

But I am still
Right here, I’m still
And you are still on the far side of the words in my will
All this time I’ve tried to break the laws of the universe
Despite knowing all too clearly
My moment is infinity

Find the light that guides you safely through your times of darkness
If you reach the other side
I’ll be waiting with arms open wide
```
