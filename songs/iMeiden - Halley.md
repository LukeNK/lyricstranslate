```
[Verse 1]
Glee, I agree
Though liars they can be, I believe it
Turned up the newscast
And set up my field glass

Chance never came when I was there to aim
but I’ll change it
Once in life, I hear the fife
It clears the blight, so full of might

And I sit there
Waiting for the light to come

[Chorus]
I know, days I’ve been wasting
I know, nights I’ve been tracing
And I scream
I know, I know
I know

So tell me,
When will my life glow?
Tell me, where will the rainbow’s end go?
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me when you find me

[Verse 2]
Doubt, I will not
Though it may come to naught, I believe it
Sped up my trail bike
And climbed up the sea dike

Not going back
Till I can see and track down with my eyes
Once in life to end the strife
I came so far to find you star

And I sit there
Waiting for the light to come

[Chorus]
I know, days I’ve been wasting
I know, nights I’ve been tracing
And I scream
I know, I know
I know

So tell me,
When will my life glow?
Tell me, where will the rainbow’s end go?
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me when you find me
```
