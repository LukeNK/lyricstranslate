```
[Verse 1]
I can't find the words in my head
Just dreams and ‘could have been’s
Swirling, dancing keeping my heart's true feelings brain-dead

I can’t say the thoughts in my mind
Something is hurting
Headaches, heart breaks making my logical love confined

But in the dark I see that
Nothing's forever
It's a mental mark to say that
It's now or never

[Chorus]
And the synapses spark
Oh to the beat of my heart
And ideas and my fears
They come flooding
But when reality hits
Between my dopamine kicks
Any doubt comes without
All the panicking

And when the night gets cold
And all the stories are told
I can see that to me
You’re a godsend
And there's a phrase in my brain
It comes again and again
It says "I'll follow you
Oh until the end."

[Verse 2]
Now I see the world through four eyes
Brown blue, me and you
Senses relay telling my heart to hold on and fly

So in the dark I feel we're
Closer together
It's a mental mark for us that
It's now or never

[Chorus]
And the synapses spark
Come to the beat of our hearts
And ideas and my tears
They come flooding
And when reality hits
Between my dopamine kicks
I just hope I can cope
With the panicking

And when the night gets cold
And all our stories are told
I can see that to me
You’re my godsend
And there's a phrase in my brain
It comes again and again
It says "I'll follow you
Oh until the end."
