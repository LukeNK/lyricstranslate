```
Lost in time
Forgotten and ignored
Out of place
Abandoned by the world

I watched as I sank into the abyss
Waiting for a hero to break my fall
'Till I realized there's no one that could save me
But myself

I can't depend
I'm on my own
Forever, ever, ever, and forevermore

I reach out my hand to an empty void
I search for the answers of an unknown world
I write out my life as my story unfolds
I hope, someday I could save the day

I cry out for help to a silent abyss
A losing battle with no end in sight
Still I will try 'cause I know I'll survive
I hope, one day I can be the main heroine

Whoa~

Left behind
Out of mind and out of sight
Still, I stand
'Cause a heroine never dies

I won't find my place, 'cause I'll create it
A miracle waits in front of me
Little by little, I can save the world if I start
with myself

The reflection on, the water surface
was the hero I, met in my dreams

How many times
I'll save my life
Again, again, again, again,
Again, again, again, again, and over again

I reached out my hand to an empty void
I searched for the answers of an unknown world
I wrote out my life as my story unfolds
I know, that soon I will save my life

I came to my rescue and fought till the end
'Cause this story still has a chapter left to write
Stood strong until I took a step back and saw
that I've already become the main heroine

Whoa~

"Even if I'm okay with being in the sidelines
Even if I'm fine with being an afterthought
Even if I've accepted being outside of the spotlight
It gets a little tiring filling the supporting role, doesn't it?"

"Although it doesn't seem like I'm doing something of worth,
Although it might not look like I'm doing something out of certainty,
Although it may not feel like I'm doing something heroic,
I know I'll have touched at least one heart, at least one life"

"But what is the purpose of the main heroine?"

"Is it to save the world?
Is it to save just one person?
Is it to save myself?"

"Is it all even worth it?..."
