```
[Verse 1]
More and more, more and more, I can see
Everything, everything coming between us
Just a gleam in the galaxy
Little more, little more, can I say
Anything, anything that would convince you
To stay anywhere by me?

Lately I’ve been looking back to our memories on the grass
Back to the evenings you held me close
And swore that we’d soar to another dimension
Staring at your starry path with the courage I seem to lack
Muster it up again, maybe you’ll show,
But then, I don’t think I’d deserve your attention

[Chorus]
How could I become so blind to your feelings?
How could I be such a fool and not know?
‘Cause it breaks my heart to see you go so far
Nowadays I find the space to start crying
Nowadays you’re fine and never alone
Though we’ve grown apart, I’m gonna count the stars

[Verse 2]
More and more, more and more, I can’t seek
Everything, everything that we were made of
Just a dream always twinkling
Little more, little more, can’t you stay?
Anything, anything would be enough if
It mean I could do one thing

Even as you’re going off, I could try to turn back the clock,
Back to the morning you said goodbye
I’m sorry I cried, but you know I can’t help it
Now I’ve looked into my thoughts, now I’m wondering, can we talk?
Sure, I can see it all taking a while
But just for a second, please let me be selfish

[Chorus]
How could I become so blind to your feelings?
How could I be such a fool and not know?
‘Cause it breaks my heart to see you go so far
Nowadays I find the space to start crying
Nowadays you’re fine and never alone
Though we’ve grown apart, I’m gonna count the stars
```
