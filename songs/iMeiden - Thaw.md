```
[Verse 1]
I was caught up in this nightmare
Running but couldn't get nowhere
Couldn't breathe because I was swimming in the frozen sea

Circled round and sought a hideout
But to cry night in and night out
'Til you came and smiled at me saying that you'd chosen me

Come close to me
Don't let go, where you are is where I'm
Supposed to be
Deep down we know how to let our heartbeats rhyme

[Verse 2]
Used to be frostbitten from lies
But now that you opened my eyes
I'm no longer blind to the world that really cares for me

I felt my soul gradually thaw
Like pure snow, not a single flaw
Brilliance of your love is always gonna be there for me

Come close to me
Don't let go, where you are is where I'm
Supposed to be
Deep down we know how to let our heartbeats rhyme
```
