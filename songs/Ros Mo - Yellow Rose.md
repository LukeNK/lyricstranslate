# Yellow Roses
```
I hear my friends find their lovers in different ways
What else is there to say?

Personally, I can't connect if they're miles away
What else is there to say?

It's a masterpiece for affection to cross the borders
Every corner a rose blesses your sight
A blush of red, blooming bright
But not me

All my roses are tinted yellow
That's just how they grow
I don't have reds like some other gardens
So pardon me if I don't know

It's just all of my roses are yellow
And that's all I have to show
Can't pretend that these petals are red
Masquerading them just because of what others have said

All of my roses are yellow
And that's how I want for now
And if that changes, well, heaven would know
For now I'll stay
I'll stay with my yellow rose
