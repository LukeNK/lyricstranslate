```
Never really thought about
Being in love, because I
Lived my life with no one by my side
Never really came around
Thinking bout being with the one
Cause I've got too much on my mind

People say
I'll never find somebody if I
Stay this way
But this is who I am so why
Can't I change
This frozen heart of mine oh I
I wanna try

Oh oh oh
Would you teach me how to feel what you call
Lo-o-ove
Let me be head over heels, I wanna
Fa-a-all
For you baby, could you show me
How to lo-o-ove
Break in deep into my heart and make me

As I lie in bed
Hoping that one day I'll forget
What I want to feel

If I say what I really mean
Would you walk away? Leave me on 'Seen'?
You know I gotta keep my heart from breaking oh
If you knew who I really was
Would it tear apart what we could have been ?
Just let me give up on

U-u-us
Is it worth it to believe what you call
Lo-o-ove
Would you really fall for someone like me
Oh oh oh
Cause my heart is beating don't forsake me
No-o-ow
Break in deep into my heart oh baby

People say
I'll never find somebody if I
Stay this way
But I know that's nothing but a lie
I won't change
Cause this is who I am and I
I wanna try

Oh oh oh
Would you teach me how to feel what you call
Lo-o-ove
Let me be head over heels, I wanna
Fa-a-all
For you baby, could you show me
How to lo-o-ove
Break in deep into my heart and make me
```
