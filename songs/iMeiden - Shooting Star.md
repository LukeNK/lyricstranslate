```
[Verse 1]
By the lines of falling starlight and dust
In these nights, I dream of you
And silent motions
Fleeting glances
Bundled up in silver memories

When I wake my hands are empty with air
Nothing left of what you gave me
Fuzzy remnants
Smiling faces
Things you showed me that I'd never seen

[Chorus]
Chasing you
In the night
To the sky
Where I'll meet you once again
Ah, with those lights
Passing by
And those dreams I kept within

To you
Reaching out
To the sound
Of your voice inside my heart
Your words
Ringing loud
All around
As I shout
Your name

[Verse 2]
Never having seen your face yet before
Even then you came again
As if our fates had
Intertwined in
Passing nights where anything could be

Something that I can't create on my own
Even now there's something missing
Something real and
Something lasting
Something that I'll never give away

[Chorus]
Flying by
On this star
Going far
And I'll meet you over there
I'll go
Where you are
In the hour
When the moonlight starts to flare

The wind
Flies away
And I pray
For my one and only chance
Ah, as I wait
For the day
When the stars come falling
```
