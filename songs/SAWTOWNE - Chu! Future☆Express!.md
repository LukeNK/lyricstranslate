```
Shaky, staggered, trip down the railway
Barely catching up to the tempo's pace

I can't brush this feeling off like on the way
There might be something I left behind

Step back and forth searching for the right path
Only to end up on a broken track...

But without the build up to the top so high
You couldn't care to feel the breeze down the slide

I know the ups and downs of life might stir up bitter feelings inside
We could laugh it away on a magic ride!

Watch the stars burst shining so bright
With you the fall's nothing to fright

There could be bumps on the way
At the end of the day think of the
Exciting ride it will make!

Within a box jam-packed with joy
Finding our old nostalgic toys

Chips of the paint and flaws are what makes us
Run along this merry-go-round!

All aboard the SEKAI★EXPRESS!
For your safety, please remain seated!

There's snacks and refreshments waiting for you
So thank you for picking SEKAI!

レオニ！（はい、はい！）
モモジャン！（きら★きら！）
ビビバス！（いいね！）
OK! OK!
ワンダショ！（わくわく！）
ニーゴ！（おはよ〜！）
よろしくね！★

What we see down our journeys might
Make it hard to go on at times

But every bump in the way and the falls that we take keep adding
A brand new joy to life!

So when you find your childhood toys
When even marbles brought you joy

Remember the way the odds and ends made us
Find the fun in every piece found!
```
