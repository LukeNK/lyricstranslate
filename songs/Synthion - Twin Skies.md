```
[Verse 1]
Remember when we couldn't find our home?
Remember when we used to be lost and alone?
We can look up to the skies above
Just knowing that you're here's enough
I'll never ever leave you on your own

I'll stay by your side
Even if we stand under different skies
Together we'll spread our wings and fly
Until we can touch the moon and the stars

We're on each other's team
We'll stand up and fight 'till the very end
We'll never give up
We'll never back down
No matter what comes
We'll be together

We'll be together

[Verse 2]
Remember when we couldn't find our home?
Remember when we used to be lost and alone?
We can look up to the skies above
Just knowing that you're here's enough
I'll never ever leave you on your own

No matter what comes
We'll be together

[Verse 3]
I'll stay by your side
Even if we stand under different skies
Together we'll spread our wings and fly
Until we can touch the moon and the stars

We're on each other's team
We'll stand up and fight 'till the very end
We'll never give up
We'll never back down
No matter what comes
We'll be together

[Outro]
Remember when we couldn't find our home?
Remember when we used to be lost and alone?
We can look up to the skies above
Just knowing that you're here's enough
I'll never ever leave you on your own
We'll be together
