# imaginary love story
```
[Verse]
A princess trapped inside a castle
Waiting for the one to come rescue me
These building blocks connect me and you
To build a bridge that goes straight to your heart

Open this door to a magical world
To a place where surprises await

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Jump to the sky!
Hey! Hey! Shoot for the stars!
Will you play along with me?
Won't you join me in my fantasy?

Hey! Hey! Let's play pretend!
Hey! Hey! Until the end!
In my future diary
Together we can write our imaginary love story

[Verse]
Stuck in a maze that I can't escape
Won't you become my light in the dark?
I'm a puzzle with one missing piece
The only one that can solve it is you

Somehow we've become two main characters
Of a brand new, untold fairy tale

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Let's run away!
Hey! Hey! Just for today!
You're the reason I can sing
Only you can be my everything

With! You! I'm not alone!
Will! You! Be my hero!
Will you save the world with me?
So that we can write our imaginary love story

[Bridge]
Hey! Hey! Let's make it true
A future with me and you
Can we turn the page again?
Please don't let our story end

Hey! Hey! By any means
I'll keep chasing this dream
Until then I'll hope and pray (Then I'll hope and pray)
That it will be true someday
Let it be
Reality

[Chorus]
Hey! Hey! Jump to the sky!
Hey! Hey! Shoot for the stars!
Will you play along with me?
Won't you join me in my fantasy?

Hey! Hey! Let's play pretend!
Hey! Hey! 'Til the very end!
In my future diary
Reality will be my imaginary love story
