```
[Verse 1]
As the night falls and draws its indigo curtains
I scribble down my thoughts
There's always something invisible but certain
Let my worries be for naught

And I
Never even knew my eyes could see the world so clearly
This life sincerely
From time to time love feels like a knife that cuts severely
Can you hear me?

And somehow yours and my tempo
Synchronized all from the get go
You're the light I cannot let go

Every day
I'll be loving you till the world we know stops spinning
Baby to myself I'll be true as you taught me how to
Cherish this moment

[Verse 2]
As the dawn breaks I take a deep breath of fresh air
No need to reminisce on
Those lonely nights when I cried and knelt down in prayer
Cause you let me stop and listen

And I
Never even knew my eyes could see the world so clearly
This life sincerely
Your love feels so unconditional that it can heal me
Can you feel me?

And somehow yours and my tempo
Synchronized all from the get go
"Catch a pulse!"
Inner voice says so

Every day
We'll be breaking through, life is full of new beginnings!
Baby to myself I'll be true as you taught me how to
Cherish this moment
```
