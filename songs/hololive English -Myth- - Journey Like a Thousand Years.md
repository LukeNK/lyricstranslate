[Intro]
Take off and fly, the longer we wait
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate
Strength to finally defeat
This journey a thousand years to meet

[Verse]
A song in snow, enchanted by rhyme
Painted in wishes granted by time
Our longest hopes, connecting, yet those
Feel like echoes of ages gone by

Made a splash, but found I'm not free
A fish out of water, bound to the sea
Yet a reckless high tide brought you right by my side
I bеt this moment’s a wave we can ridе

Connecting songs across the sky

[Chorus]
Take off and fly, the longer we wait
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate
Strength to finally defeat
This journey a thousand years to meet

[Verse]
Witness the fire in our minds, burning inside
Rising again from the ashes
Every bruise, any scratches make us feel more alive
We never give up, never give in
No matter what's ahead
Instead, we'll crush our worries aside

If there’s no world for us to touch or to see
We'll make it ourselves then make memories
There ain't a mystery our brains cannot solve
We just shine brighter, grow tighter, evolve

Connecting songs across that wall

[Chorus]
Take off and fly, the longer we wait
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate
Strength to finally defeat
This journey a thousand years to meet

[Bridge]
At the end of this world
Where's our fighting chance?
Nothing's changing
It's always the same story staged with a different dance

Seek out a happy end for me, my friends
And those who've loved us up 'till now
I wanna see your smile
Find my way to you somehow

[Chorus]
Take off and fly, the longer we wait
The stronger it makes us as we fight every fate
Strength to finally defeat
This journey a thousand years to meet

Let’s try, it can’t be denied
The wish in my heart is you, right here by my side
Strength is all that we'll need
I won’t wait a thousand years to meet
