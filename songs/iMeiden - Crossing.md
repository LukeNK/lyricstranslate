```
[Verse 1]
So many miles across the waves
God, tell me, can my heart reach that far?
Can I break free from all these chains
And finally let our eyes meet?

Ten thousand meters above the ocean and land
Anticipation is growing hard to withstand
I’m in disbelief that you’re only hours away from me

[Chorus]
Once we’re hand in hand we’ll have done it
We did what everyone said can’t be
When I meet your gaze I am reassured that this is reality

Though our time may be limited we both know that memories last for life
So let’s make this summer eternal, these few days that you and I will be
Side by side

[Verse 2]
Who knows when this will happen once again
Will it be when all of the stars are aligned?
“Something unforeseen may happen, and what then?”
Don’t you worry, I know fate will be kind

With no activities or plans in mind
‘cause we know that the company will suffice
At last we both can leave all the doubt behind
And brace for the element of surprise

So many miles across the waves
God, tell me, can my heart reach that far?
Can I break free from all these chains
And finally let our eyes meet?

Ten thousand meters above the ocean and land
Anticipation is growing hard to withstand
I’m in disbelief that you’re only hours away from me

[Chorus]
Once we’re hand in hand we’ll have done it
We did what everyone said can’t be
When I meet your gaze I am reassured that this is reality

Though our time may be limited we both know that memories last for life
So let’s make this summer eternal, these few days that you and I will be
Side by side

[Verse 3]
Who knows when this will happen once again
Will it be when all of the stars are aligned?
“Something unforeseen may happen, and what then?”
Don’t you worry, I know fate will be kind

With no activities or plans in mind
‘cause we know that the company will suffice
At last we both can leave all the doubt behind
Now, I see you, smiling with gleaming eyes

Never has an embrace felt quite this warm
Never has something awkward felt quite this sweet
Our emotions are thrown right out of their norm
Your hand in mine signals the journey’s complete
```
