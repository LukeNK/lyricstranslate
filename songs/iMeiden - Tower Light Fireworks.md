```
[Verse 1]
Running with the wind
to a place atop a hill
Shining brightly
Were those fireworks that flared up overhead
In the end
I could only remember the lights in the show

Warm and glittering
Like a flower in the sky
I never could forget
all the colors sprinkling out in rainbow lines
crossing by
to the edge of my sight as it goes up above

[Chorus]
As I'm on my way
Coming home today
I'll be waiting there
On a lonely prayer
For the first time since that happy night
I'll see those bright shining lights
Flying straight through the sky

With the stars softly twinkling
Moonlight singing
Rockets flaring
Light beams narrowing
For the first time since that happy night
Those things will be in my sight
And I'll be there standing by

[Verse 2]
In a lonely town
I spend all my days in wait
For that something
From that day I saw those never ending flames
But the same
helpless days will do nothing but keep passing by

In my daily life
I'll continue living
for the things that I can do
But I'll always keep on reaching out for home
All alone
While I'm over in here looking up to the sky

[Chorus]
As I'm on my way
Coming home today
I'll be waiting there
On a lonely prayer
Bringing back things that I've found since then
I'll have it all kept within
With it here to the end

With the stars softly twinkling
Moonlight singing
Rockets flaring
Light beams narrowing
Bringing back things that I've found since then
The colors shower and spin
I'll let it all out again
```
