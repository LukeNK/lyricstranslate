[Chorus]
The tree's wrapped up in lights
And you're close by my side
You're all I need, it's true
The greatest gift is you

The fire's warm and bright
So we'll stay in tonight
You're all I need, it's true
The greatest gift is you

[Verse]
You bring joy to my soul
With your fingers in the holes of my sweater
You bring warmth to the cold
Always find a way to make me feel better

The snow is slowly falling down
I see the presents all around
But nothing could compare to you
No

[Chorus]
The tree's wrapped up in lights
And you're close by my side
You're all I need, it's true
The greatest gift is you

The fire's warm and bright
So we'll stay in tonight
You're all I need, it's true
The greatest gift is you

The greatest, the greatest, the greatest
The greatest gift is you
The greatest, the greatest, the greatest
The greatest gift is you

[Verse]
I can't help how I feel
When you're near it just feels like Christmas
'Cause every kiss from your lips
Makes me feel like you're granting my wishes

Didn't know what I was missing
Until you showed me the missing piece
Now every night is like Christmas Eve
'Cause every day with you is a gift to me

[Chorus]
The tree's wrapped up in lights
And you're close by my side
You're all I need, it's true
The greatest gift is you

The fire's warm and bright
So we'll stay in tonight
You're all I need, it's true
The greatest gift is you

[Outro]
The greatest, the greatest, the greatest
The greatest gift is you
The greatest, the greatest, the greatest
The greatest gift is you

All I need is
All I need is
All I need is you
The greatest gift is you
