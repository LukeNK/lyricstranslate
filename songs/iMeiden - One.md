```
[Verse 1]
High the summer sun
It's calling to go
So we take our water guns
And swiftly get ot our feet
Dive into the lawn together
On the count of three
Fighting one-on-one
Kids we will always be

Every time I find a wall ahead
You'll say I can get over it
Every time you ponder the way ahead
I'll say you'll be all right

[Chorus]
'Cruz we're deeply connected at soul
We know that even if the world fell to pieces
We'd never let go
Without a doubt I will say
that we're deeply connected at soul
We know that time never waits or surceases
But never let go
We found it out
We are made as one

We know we have nothing to fear
and on and on
We will go
At last, time is over for tears
And on and on and on
We are one

[Verse 2]
Pouring summer rain
It's holding us here
But we know it's not in vain
To wait till it disappears
Run into the light
And find where the rainbonw ends
Laughing all the way
Kids we will always be

Every time you find a wall ahead
I'll say you can get over it
Every time I ponder the way ahead
You'll say I'll be all right

[Chorus]
'Cruz we're deeply connected at soul
We know that even if the world fell to pieces
We'd never let go
Without a doubt I will say
that we're deeply connected at soul
We know that time never waits or surceases
But never let go
We found it out
We are made as one

We know we have nothing to fear
and on and on
We will go
At last, time is over for tears
And on and on and on
We are one
```
