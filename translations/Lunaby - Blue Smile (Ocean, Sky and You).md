## Blue Smile (Ocean, Sky and You)
```
[Verse]
In the middle of the dark
Someone is still dreaming
Hands sketching nonstop
The eyelashes twitching
Where the unknown depth of the deep ocean
Where the blue sky white clouds floating
Lost in a maze, oh no
Only need to know a thing is

[Chorus]
One, two, three! Let's smile
You are the bright moon twinkling on the sky
If there is sadness then throw it away, don't keep it in your heart
For a future no longer sobbing in the middle of the night
Do you know

The sky is blue, the clouds are white
And nothing is better than your smile
I know you’re not alone
I know you can be strong

So take my hand, let's heal the pain
Through every storm, we'll break the chain
Fly high into the sky
Together, you and I

[Verse]
Take a deep breath, my baby
Continue to walk don't mind the pains, my baby
Because life still have a lot of challenges
But we still hope that one day
Keep the habits of strolling on the sidewalks
No longer being tangled in the dark late night
Complete the painting, put on the blue[fn]"Xanh" can be blue or green[/fn] shirt
Beautiful like the stars on the sky

[Chorus]
One, two, three! Let's smile
You are the bright moon twinkling on the sky
If there is sadness then throw it away, don't keep it in your heart
For a future no longer sobbing in the middle of the night
Do you know

The sky is blue, the clouds are white
And nothing is better than your smile
I know you’re not alone
I know you can be strong

So take my hand, let's heal the pain
Through every storm, we'll break the chain
Fly high into the sky
Together, you and I

[Bridge]
Even when the wishes are not fulfilled
We still swim in the blue river
To the stormy high sea
Watch the shiny sparking surface

We will have a ticket
For the hardships to end quickly
For the dreams to be no longer fragile
Realize a blue dream

[Chorus]
The sky is blue, the clouds are white
And nothing is better than your smile (your smile)
I know you’re not alone (alone)
I know you can be strong (you can be strong)

So take my hand, let's heal the pain (the pain)
Through every storm, we'll break the chain (the chain)
Fly high into the sky (the sky)
Together you and I (you and I)
```
