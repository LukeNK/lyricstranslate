# A Letter From Heaven
```
In the sky, a letter in hand
An angel flying, flapping her wings
Deliver someone's promise, someone's regret
Across the sea, far away

In a single flash of life
What did they see?
She will never know
The world outside that she can't see

The past sceneries, are now hazy memories
Beyond the canyon, to the next town
Broken promises and regrets that will never be fulfilled
Carried by the wind until it arrives

Like a ray of light
Disappear like a breath
She can't understand
The secrets that she will never know

In the sky, a letter in hand
An angel flying, flapping her wings
The will she delivered turn into a breeze
Caressing someone's cheek
```
