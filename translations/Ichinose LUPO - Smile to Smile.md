# Smile to Smile
```
I feel like I am meeting you here
Under the same sky as that day

I once saw you at the other end of the radio wave
Connected to a distant unknown world

Even if the colour you painted is not vibrant
Even if the sound you played is not pleasant
This is a place where you can be yourself
Even if it is nonsense, you can try again
Draw a tomorrow that no one knows
Let me just hear your voice only

(Smile to Smile) with you
(Smile to Smile) forever
(Smile to Smile) whenever
(Smile to Smile) wherever

Let's carry this voice to greet tomorrow
Heading toward the unknown now

Thinking of you on the other side of the world
Are you seeing the page I read on that day?

Here are billions of different sparkles
Becoming one in this instant
For me to be myself
Proving that you can be you
I believe in this one thing
So I look for it

Even if it is painful, crying because of the worries
This time is yours to change
The darkness and the endless rain is over
Let's go and paint the rainbow hangs above us

Even if the colour you painted is not vibrant
Even if the sound you played is not pleasant
This is a place where you can be yourself
Even if it is nonsense, you can try again
Draw a tomorrow that no one knows
Let me just hear your voice only

(Smile to Smile) with you
(Smile to Smile) forever
(Smile to Smile) whenever
(Smile to Smile) wherever

(Smile to Smile) until the end
(Smile to Smile) eternally
(Smile to Smile) tomorrow too
(Smile to Smile) from now on too

(Smile to Smile) with you
(Smile to Smile) forever
(Smile to Smile) whenever
(Smile to Smile) wherever
