# Hello, SEKAI
```
"Someday, our frequencies will meet, somehow, the veils will lift"
That bright future had me at hello, in my "SEKAI" all alone
All this time I sang that song

Something just reached my ears, a slight vibration
I feel you, my melody touches yours
Connecting now, intertwining now
My backlog of transmissions, a mountain worth to process, where should I start?

I've never seen that face before, as you tell yourself that you're no good
Don't let the perfect future you, give the current you such a hard time
I've never seen this sight, till the day we reveal that to each other
Heartbreaks and tears, let me hold yours while you hold mine

"Hello, SEKAI", has my voice reached you yet?
It's alright, better than I imagined, you're not alone, not even a little bit
"Hello, SEKAI", your voices reached me just fine
It's incredible, better than I imagined, I'm not alone, not even a little bit

Ready, set and jump! Leap up and dance
Useless worries, let's leave them in the dust
What if's and if only's, they don't matter
Let's just do what we want, hello hello

One more time, jump! Twirl to that dance
That bright future, it's almost within reach
What if's and if only's, they don't matter
Let's just do what we want

Let's jump into our world "SEKAI" even if
We don't know what's right and what's wrong
That hope that I now have, that hope that you still have
That's for forever, no doubt, SEKAI is forever too

Connecting now, intertwining now
Hearts vibrating, and now transmitting, to all of us
