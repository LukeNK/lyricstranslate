## Dance beneath the blue sky
```
Within four corners of an empty forest, welcome a sunlit morning
Lightly nudge me out of a sound sleep
Chartering chirps echo, whistle with the flower still
Beautifully paint a clear day
That is my world, morning not being late
In the evening, no need to overtime
Being free with a lot of time, so always find
Emotions that are never

Until today, suddenly see a far away place filled with happiness and chants
Bustling with many colourful lights
Should I adventure for a little while

Dancing in my paradise
Stroll through a street so long
Waves of people, the lights sparkling
My eyes wide open follow the rolling wheel
Dancing in the city nights
The late night is like smiling
Don't want to fall asleep, the rain turns into reality
Right here name the adventure: colourful city

There are many strange dishes, different from tasty apple and mushroom
A lot of times have to fight through the crowd after work
Questions not yet to be made, somehow asked me to find the answer
A new world that is never
Just until today
Suddenly realized I am loving life more than myself yesterday
Gently with millions colourful sparkles
Hey do you want to have an adventure with me

Breathing in the new twilight
Put hand on the pages, absorbed
Through each language, heart immersed
Tomorrow is still unknown but still so cheerful
Jumping in the pale blue sky
The floating cloud is like still waiting
I quickly continue on the many unfamiliar paths
Right here name the adventure: glorious city

Around us still many things yet to discover, a dazing painting
Let's quickly go play toward a direction we haven't been to
With the shinning new dawn, illuminates everywhere

Dancing in this brand-new world
Stroll through a street so long
Waves of people, the lights sparkling
My eyes wide open follow the rolling wheel

Soaring higher, it's our world
Touch many amazing light rays
I quickly continue on the many unfamiliar paths
Right here name the adventure: colourful city

A future so vibrant is still waiting
Right here name the adventure: colourful city
