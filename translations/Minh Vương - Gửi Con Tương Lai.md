# To You in The Future
```
My future child
Do you know that I love Mom very much
Since the first time I met
I knew I belong to your mom.

Through many challenges
Dad and Mom still stay with each other
When thinking about the days that I have Mom
I never regretted a single moment.

Be proud that you have a mom
Who always sacrifices herself
I promise that for whatever reason
Never let your mom shed a tear.

When you grow up you will
Feel the things you listened
You will learn the way to love a person
As deeply as what Dad did.

And happiness always smile when
You knew how to give everything
The passion in your heart
Cherished in a peaceful soul
And wanting to tell this entire world, I love you both.

Life sometimes has stormy times
Please head back to the family's warmth
Where the smiles will give you strength
To steadily walking the path.

Please appreciate the woman who stays beside you
Shares every emotion
It is not easy to find your other half
Don't let her have to cry.

And I will always watch every step
Growing up that you walked
I will do everything that I can
To give you all the loves.

And someday you won't be small to be
Peaceful in Mom's arms
Live for yourself
Live for the future family
And you will have the things, you used to wish.

When you grow up you will
Feel the things you listened
You will learn the way to love a person
As deeply as what Dad did.

And happiness always smile when
You knew how to give everything
The passion in your heart
Cherished in a peaceful soul
And wanting to tell this entire world,
I love you both.

In this song, "I" is the father, talking to his child ("you").
