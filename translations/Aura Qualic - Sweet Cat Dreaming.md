# Sweet Cat Dreaming
Poetic singable lyrics
```
It doesn't matter if, there's an orange sun
The little kitten, curled into a fur ball
And sleep peacefully, it is just, a little bit too cute

Hey, why up on the pale blue sky
White clouds, are floating away
Can you please stop, stay in this wonderful moment

Your sweet face is falling asleep
It is like a time for me to keep
Curl into a ball, leave all of my worries
Like a cat, on the floor, fall into a dream

Between the steady breaths, there is a smiling face
There's a gentle breeze, softly play with the cat's fur
It purrs happily, the ears twitch, ask for someone to pet

Hey, why is the sun still setting
And why, the clock is still moving
Stretching out the legs, a lazy yawn to move the tail

The eyelids are being heavy
The warm sunlight makes me feel sleepy
Curl into a ball, leave all of my worries
Like a cat, on the floor, falling to a dream

Your sweet face is falling asleep
It is like a time for me to keep
Curl into a ball, leave all of my worries
Like a cat, on the floor, fall into a dream

The eyelids are being heavy
The warm sunlight makes me feel sleepy
Curl into a ball, leave all of my worries
Like a cat, on the floor, falling to a dream

Sleeping like a cat

Your sweet face is falling asleep
It is like a time for me to keep
Curl into a ball, leave all of my worries
Like a cat, on the floor, fall into a dream

Dreaming like a cat
```

I don't have a cat, I have no intention to have one, but I love cats anyway.
