# alive
```
The words I had painted now flow forth from the blank canvas of my feelings,
heading beyond where I'd heard the sound,
and the shape of the world is dyed in seven colors.

I heard your singing voice, and it guided me to you,
as the light that illuminated my path forward.

Because I heard your voice in this world with nothing,
from the tiny sound I'd found, an answer was born, leading the way.

The words I had painted now flow forth from the blank canvas of my feelings,
heading beyond where I'd heard the sound,
and the shape of the world is dyed in seven colors.

My words are still too small; even if I stretch out my hand,
I can't reach it, from my corner of the world.
My feelings have now began to move, in this very moment.

I've been reborn; your singing voice leads me closer and closer to your sound.
It feels like I could reach you any second now.

So that I won't lose anything, I'll keep it closed up in here.
Because I'll find color to fill in the pages of my blank notebook.

Even to someone like me, who can't do anything, your voice was right there.
Because I've made it all the way here, because I've finally arrived,
I'll fill in the pages with our colors.

The future we've created together, as well as the path that's lead us here,
are the things that will never change.

The words I had painted now flow forth from the blank canvas of my feelings,
heading beyond where I'd heard the sound,
and the shape of the world is dyed in seven colors.

My words are still too small; even if I stretch out my hand,
I can't reach it, from my corner of the world.
My feelings have now began to move, in this very moment.
