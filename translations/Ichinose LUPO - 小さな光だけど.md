```
A melody you played, a song that you created
An ice candle, warming up the night
Please don't melt away, stay in this winter starry sky
Shining right by my side, keeping you by my side

Tracing the footprints you left, the lights and the sounds that you made
Connect your heart, to my feelings, like a straight line, a snow path

Cover it with my hands, I won't lose sight of it
So wind will not turn it off
Because you're here in this small town, painted on the white canvas of the snow

A melody you played, a song that you created
An ice candle, warming up the night
Please don't melt away, stay in this winter starry sky
Shining right by my side, keeping you by my side

I know it is fragile, and easy to crumble
It is a tiny light after all
Even so, I am staying right here
Because I follow your voice, so I can find my way

The light make ways for us to walk, alongside the footprints that we made
Illuminate, brilliantly, the path lies ahead, through the town

Even if lights are to fade, and we are in the dark
I hope you will stay around
Because I always want to reach you, right here in this winter-warm town

A melody you played, a song that you created
An ice candle, warming up the night
Please don't melt away, stay in this winter starry sky
Shining right by my side, keeping you by my side

I know it is fragile, and easy to crumble
It is a tiny light after all
Even so, I am staying right here
Because I follow your voice, so I can find my way

All the songs, that I sing, my voice will carry
So it can reach your heart

There is a shining sound, like a song that you wrote
It's like a light, brighten up the night
Together we sing, and never stop before the spring
The dreamy melody, a hymn of you and me

I know it is fragile, and easy to crumble
It is a tiny light after all
Even so, I am staying right here
Because I follow your voice, so I can find my way
