## Let Daddy Tell You
```
[Verse 1]
When I was smaller than the guitar
Focused on the ringing strings
Released, pressed, the echoes
The space filled with sounds
Piano was much harder
And the tiny little hands
Still glided on the keys, still filled with dreams
The space filled with love

When I was 8, was 10
Bad at guitar so I tried playing drums
The anxious feet trembled
My hands missed[fn]Despite "đánh" means play, in this case it is used to imply that he messed up[/fn] everything
How many long years has it been?
How many quiet years I'm still smiling?
I dreamed so many, I wished so much
Dad love you[fn]The child of the dad[/fn] so much

[Chorus]
With music, you are the bliss
With music, you are a river, are a field, a rice field
Lying beneath the endless sky
Like back when grandma sing me to sleep
Sometimes am the breezy summer noon
Sometimes am a joy, I am a sadness, a sadness
Because I was sick from the rain[fn]"sương" means fog but can also means light rain[/fn]
Grandpa taught me to grow up fiercely

[Verse 2]
Today I have music
I love it like love you, an endless love[fn]I never felt bored[/fn]
Gave you each soothing note
You took the words and sing
Tomorrow you will be much stronger
Tomorrow you will protect so many things
For mom's dreams, for mom's struggles
Let's take care them with me

[Chorus]
With music, you are the bliss
With music, you are a river, are a field, a rice field
Lying beneath the endless sky
Like back when grandma sing me to sleep
Sometimes am the breezy summer noon
Sometimes am a joy, I am a sadness, a sadness
Because I was sick from the rain
Grandpa taught me to grow up fiercely

[Chorus]
With music, you are the bliss
With music, you are a river, are a field, a rice field
Lying beneath the endless sky
Like back when grandma sing me to sleep

With music, you are the bliss
With music, you are a river, are a field, a rice field
Lying beneath the endless sky
Like back when grandma sing me to sleep
Sometimes am the breezy summer noon
Sometimes am a joy, I am a sadness, a sadness
Because I was sick from the rain
Grandpa taught me to grow up fiercely

[Outro]
Today I have music
I love it like love you, an endless love
Gave you each soothing note
You took the words and sing
Tomorrow you will be much stronger
Tomorrow you will protect so many things
For mom's dreams, for mom's struggles
Let's take care them with me

This is my first time translating, so please tell me if there is any mistake.

When translating, I was a bit stuck at the "ba" translation, because it was used a pronoun means "I/me" but also implied the fact that the speaker is the dad of the listener. I decided to settle with using "I/me" for most of the song (the title for example) to create that personal feeling the original song gave me.
