## Our Summer Will Come Again
Singable lyrics
```
[Verse]
The summer is calling to me, through the wide crevice a blazing heat
The shiny sun's finding ways to slip into my memory

Hate the cold, the path that I walked through, the days that I can't laugh on my own
But just like you, I remained anxious and nothing ever changed

Hey really, we all want to live our life the way we want in our heart
I was waiting for an "I don't know" and an "I can't do it" through the tears
There were a lot of memories and bad times that we want to forget
But whenever we looking back on them they seem so beautiful

[Chorus]
I wonder what was the future that we all saw on our awfullest day?
What was the thing that you believed in even in your darkest times?
Even if the sky that you remember is still somewhere at the back of your head
You can stand up, overcome the hurdle, no matter
How many times!

[Verse]
The sun melts every boring day into the colours of our memories
So we get the brushes, filling the blank with the flowers and the scenery

And just for a single second, it was a miracle beyond what we dream
We can't never forget, I keep thinking about that summer deep in my heart

[Chorus]
There's nothing wrong with crying out loud when you fall or you get hurt
Even covered in mud or getting scraped is all a part of life
What is so scary about falling down and getting a little dirt on your hand?
The lesson and the question that you have told me so many times...

[Bridge]
Where were the days that you gave me the days the sky being so blue?
Or the orange flower that looking at the sun that is setting?
It is not too late if you want to change the way that how everything is now
Let's go, running toward the sun, jump up, there're so many things that we can do today!

[Chorus]
What is the summer that we can paint with all the smiles we made?
Did we fulfill that promise that we made under the setting sun?
Our summer that we used to know will come again, I promise just for you
Because you were there, keeping the promise we made: living life to the fullest
Because of you, I keep moving forward, courageously!
