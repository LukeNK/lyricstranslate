# Thanks a lot!
```
For the taverns of coke
And the bars that booked us
The tiny 4x8 stage
With some shitty sound system

For the smell of spaghetti
In the CEGEP shows at noon
And the pitiful moments
Standing on the table and sing

For all the cafeterias
Where no one listen to us
For the job that we have
As our room emptied

Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!

For all the place we visited
Where we would have never gone
And those where we went
Without really visited

For the thousands of hours on the road
To eat sandwiches without the crusts
And the tour bus in Europe
Where the party went on non-stop

For the lights of Pigalle
And the white nights in Chicoutimi
And the aurora borealis
That we watched together my darling

Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot!

For the little guys from a good family
The old punk or the gang of girls
Who came to give us a break
In this daily life that we love

For the annoying folks who yelled
The titles that we never played
Or for there is a little weirdo
Who flashed us her jos all the time

For tons of bear cases
That you drank with your fist in the air
In all the festival trash
Where it smells like cow dung

Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot!

For all the junk rooms
And the giant arenas full of people
The hangovers on the tarmac
And all the terrible late night snacks
For the tours, the trips
And the souvenirs in our baggages
Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!

For this bizarre epic
Based on friendships
That will resist life
And I hope death too

For the jams in the moonlight
In front of a brown motel room
And the laughter in the festive night
That keep resonant in our heads

For the millions of human beings
That we crossed path
For your lighters in the sky
And your big immortal smiles

Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot!

Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot! Thanks a lot!
Thanks a lot!

(Thank you!)
