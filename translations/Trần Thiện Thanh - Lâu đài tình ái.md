## Castle of Love
```
Because of you I will write love poems
I will make a castle from clouds
Wait a certain moonlit night
Wait a sun-kissed afternoon
Wait a new romantic space
To take only both of us away

The stars in the sky make a bright crown
Start the coronation, witnessed by the universe
The noble queen arrived magnificently
The classy smile pleased the monarchs
And the castle with the name "Love"
Welcome both of us only

My dear that's the love castle
Probably doesn't exist in this Earth
I brought you there by music
Flap these silky angelic wings
My dear that's the love castle
Brighten on another far planet
So even for thousands years
There remains two lovely souls

I build the flower floors with love poems
For your twinkle eyes until forever
Our love story never seen a lie
The first promise hasn't been forgotten
So the castle with the name "Love"
Welcome both of us only
```
