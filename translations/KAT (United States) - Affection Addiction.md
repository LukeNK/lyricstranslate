[Intro]
Woah I think I’m addicted, I’m addicted
I’m addicted, I’m addicted
I’m addicted, I’m addicted
Or so I think I’m addicted, I’m addicted
I’m addicted, I’m addicted to the friction of an artificial love

[Verse]
Two steps forward, three steps back
And I knew right from the jump I’d get too attached
But I fell hard, who can blame me for that?
When I knew right from the jump it was a perfect match

Thought I learned my lesson, started playing by the book
All that self improvement out the window with one look

Look me in the eye, hold me close just for tonight
Watching hours passing by, and I wanna last till the morning light
So do you think I’m just desperate when I’m down on my luck?
Or do you know that I’m obsessed with how it feels when we f-

[Chorus]
Woah I think I’m addicted, I’m addicted to love
I’m out of sync, self-inflicted, but it fits like a glove
Woah I think I’m addicted, I just can’t get enough
I’m on the brink, it's so predicted but it feels so off the cuff

And I know that it's a waste of time
But I can’t survive without the high
So-oh I think I’m addicted to the way that we touch
I’m like a lovesick junkie begging you for one more little puff

[Verse]
You got me messed up, stressed, depressed
Rotting in my bed, overthinking every single word you said
Cause I’m too invested, I feel possessed
Am I crazy for wanting us to be mutually obsessed?

Look me in the eye, say you need me to survive
Anything to make you mine, even if it's only one more night
So do you think life is hell and I’m your one stroke of luck?
Or do you know that I can tell that you don’t really give a f-

[Chorus]
Woah I think, I’m addicted, I’m addicted to love
I wanna scream, so conflicted, but you’re making me blush
Woah I think, I’m addicted, the adrenaline rush
I know you’re lying to my face but I won’t ever call your bluff

And I know that it's a waste of time
But I can’t survive without the high
So-oh I think I’m addicted to the concept of us
But with the way you look at him, I know I’ll never be enough

[Bridge]
I’m so hung up, I’ve had enough, I wanna quit this
I’m so fed up with lust and love, don’t know the difference
Am I a whore if I adore this cheap ambivalence?

I know that it’s out of my control
All I want is to feel beautiful

[Chorus]
Woah I think I’m addicted, I’m addicted to love
I’m out of sync, self inflicted, but it fits like a glove
Woah I think I’m addicted, I just can’t get enough
I’m on the brink, it's so predicted but it feels so off the the cuff

And I know that it's a waste of time
But I can’t survive without the high
So-oh I think I’m addicted to the way that we touched
I’m like a lovesick junkie begging you for one more final puff

[Outro]
Woah I think I’m addicted, I’m addicted
I’m addicted, I’m addicted
I’m addicted, I’m addicted
Or so I think I’m addicted, I’m addicted
I’m addicted, I’m an idiot for thinking I was worthy of your love
