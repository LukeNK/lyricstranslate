## I Want to Be A Girl
```
Hey I wanna be a cute pretty girl
Can I just become one please?

Going through a forest of chocolate color
On a pumpkin carriage with two snow white horse
Riding far away, into wonderland
A milk dyed castle waiting for me

Everybody has dreamed of the main character
Being the center of a nice fairy tale
I want to become, the protagonist
With a pair of glass high heels

A secret emotion, my honest emotion
I'll share it a tiny bit
One two three! Cast on a magical spell
I really want to become, a different person, even for once!

I want to be cute from the deepest place of my feeling
I want to be cute just like the princess from the story
Put on the frilly dress and tie a ribbon
Let's become the one and only Cinderella!

A little courage and a huge leap for this tiny dream
My feet is trembling from fear, I might try to run away
I wanna be a cute pretty girl!
Can I just become one please?
Can I continue stay in this dream?

With this weird voice that never reach into right pitch
And a body isn't what I imagined
Whatever I do, whatever I try
Nothing seems to work out like my plan

In that case!
Even for a moment when I'm sleeping at night
I will try to find myself in fantasies
With every heartbeat, with every second
I feel like I can change something

I'm ready but my heart is racing
I cannot sleep out of pure excitement
One two three! Getting my thoughts together
The gate to my fairy tale, is wide open now, and is right there!

The sun shines through the dark clouds after I turn up my eyes
One wink to stop fights and bring peace as far as I can see
Tie a ribbon and then talk with a soft tone
Let's unite the entire world with Cinderella!

Being someone that make the flowers blush from the shyness
Being someone that keep me a little bit to my true self
I want to be a girl just like that!
May I stay here by your side?

Of all the natural thing that expected from me
I don't think that is what I want
One two three! Fill all my heart with courage
To take that step to my dream, to become a new me, to be a girl!

I want to be a girl and be cute in fluffy dresses
I want to be a girl just like the fairy tale princess
Tilting my neck and stepping down the carriage
Everybody look at me like Cinderella!

Before I waste today hiding in a room corner and
Before I lose sense of what is myself in this chaos world
I want to be a cute pretty girl!
Can I just become one please?
Is it okay to remain like this?

It's a secret!
